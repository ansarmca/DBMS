-- Question 1:
-- Create a table faculty in MySQL database with the following
schema and constraints: 
faculty (fno, fname, doj, specialization)
fno (faculty number) is an integer attribute. fname (faculty name)
is a variable length character attribute, with a maximum size of 15.
doj (faculty joining date) is a date attribute and should not be
empty. specialization (faculty specialization) is a variable length
character attribute with a maximum size of 50.

Constraints to set for the table faculty:

1. fno is the primary key and must be an auto incrementing
attribute
2. fname should not be empty.
3. doj should not be empty and must be greater than January
01, 2000.

CREATE TABLE faculty (
    fno INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    fname VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    doj DATE NOT NULL CHECK (doj > '2000-01-01'),
    specialization VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Question 2:
-- Create a table subject in MySQL database with the following
schema and constraints: (4 Marks)
subject (sname, sdate, edate, roomno, fno)
sname (subject name) is a variable length character attribute with
a maximum size of 50. sdate (start date of teaching a subject) is a
date attribute. edate (end date of teaching a subject) is a date
attribute. roomno (room number where the subject is taught) must
be of a fixed length character attribute with a size of 4.
fno (faculty number) is an integer attribute.


Constraints to set for the table subject:
1. sname and sdate together form the primary key.
2. sname should not be empty.
3. sdate shoud not be empty.
4. edate shoud not be empty.
5. roomno should not be empty.
6. fno is the foreign key attribute that referes to fno attribute of
faculty table.


CREATE TABLE subject (
    sname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    sdate DATE NOT NULL,
    edate DATE NOT NULL,
    roomno CHAR(4) NOT NULL,
    fno INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (sname, sdate),
    FOREIGN KEY (fno) REFERENCES faculty(fno)
);

-- Question 3:
-- Insert records into faculty
INSERT INTO faculty (fno, fname, doj, specialization) VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', '2020-01-15', 'Computer Science'),
(2, 'Jane Smith', '2018-05-20', 'Mathematics'),
(3, 'Alice Johnson', '2019-09-10', 'Physics'),
(4, 'Bob William', '2021-03-25', 'Chemistry'),
(5, 'Emily Brown', '2017-11-08', 'Biology'),
(6, 'Michael Green', '2020-08-10', 'Economics');

-- Question 4:
-- Insert records into subject
INSERT INTO subject (sname, sdate, edate, roomno, fno) VALUES
('Introduction to Programming', '2024-01-10', '2024-05-10', 'C101', 1),
('Linear Algebra', '2024-02-15', '2024-06-15', 'T102', 2),
('Mechanics', '2024-06-20', '2024-10-20', 'T102', 2),
('Mechanics', '2024-03-20', '2024-07-20', 'M103', 3),
('Organic Chemistry', '2024-04-25', '2024-08-25', 'T104', 4),
('Cell Biology', '2024-01-15', '2024-05-15', 'T105', 5);

-- Question 5:
-- Query 1: Faculty specialization includes 'm'
SELECT fno, fname FROM faculty
WHERE specialization LIKE '%m%';

-- Query 2: Faculties who joined after April 01, 2024
SELECT fno, fname FROM faculty
WHERE doj > '2024-04-01';

-- Query 3: Faculties teaching subjects starting after March 01, 2024
SELECT DISTINCT f.fno, f.fname
FROM faculty f
JOIN subject s ON f.fno = s.fno
WHERE s.sdate > '2024-03-01';

-- Query 4: Subjects with faculty name and specialization, ordered by sdate
SELECT s.sname, f.fname, f.specialization
FROM subject s
JOIN faculty f ON s.fno = f.fno
ORDER BY s.sdate ASC;

-- Query 5: Subjects taught by the most recently joined faculty
SELECT f.fname, f.doj, s.sname
FROM faculty f
JOIN subject s ON f.fno = s.fno
ORDER BY f.doj DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Query 6: Faculty not teaching any subject
SELECT fname FROM faculty
WHERE fno NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT fno FROM subject);

-- Query 7: Subjects with number of faculty teaching each
SELECT sname, COUNT(DISTINCT fno) AS num_faculty
FROM subject
GROUP BY sname;

-- Query 8: Faculty names with count of subjects taught, ordered by count
SELECT f.fname, COUNT(s.sname) AS subject_count
FROM faculty f
LEFT JOIN subject s ON f.fno = s.fno
GROUP BY f.fname
ORDER BY subject_count DESC;
